Creative Coding Response              Things To Do With VideoGames

“Perhaps in 1982 the world was not ready for a video game about
the loneliness and frailty of an extraterrestrial. But, oddly, we
were ready for a film about it."
I think this is a stark example of the potential that video games have over film as a way to put the viewer in the position of the subject and create a more empathetic relationship. While im not sure if this was the main reason the game didn’t sell well, at the time, relating to a subject (E.T.) in such a way was too uncomfortable to viewers. However,  viewing it as a film with a sequence of events and decisions chosen by someone else was just unrelatable enough.

	I feel like one difference with video games is the decision making aspect. The more a viewer starts to take action and have choices as a character, the more they feel the attachment and responsibility for the outcome. In many games I feel bad if I have to kill an animal or a helpless npc, and many only give you the choice to harm. A game like Undertale is heavily influenced by traditional 8 bit battle games, but it takes a intentional turn by providing alternative ways to progress. The creator, Toby Fox, loved early games like Earthbound and Pokemon, but felt it was always the same violent approach; stumble across a random enemy or boss, and you must kill them or be killed, or possibly run away. In Undertale these options are still there, but you can also talk your way out of situations, either to protect yourself, or to convince the enemy to stop fighting so you don’t have to hurt them. 
       Sometimes deeper concepts are more effective and easier to digest when they are depicted as happening to monsters and unfamiliar personas, but many contemporary games go straight to the point, and utilize the art form to create empathy and awareness for real life situations, such as the horrors that victims of war are experiencing, as portrayed in the games Hush and Darfur is Dying. As we saw, at the time of E.T. these concepts where too overwhelming through the medium, but now works are being created that are capable of powerful influence and providing much needed awareness.

On a separate note, I have found that putting commonly intimidating activities such as music making or design into forms that are more like a game allows for people to engage in creative practices without feeling like they need to know how to use an instrument or software. I think this could be expanded to many other areas such as video editing and different creative processes. When something gets stripped down and practical it becomes more accessible and influences creativity. For me, the Bitsy game making software felt similar to this, making the creation of a sophisticated interactive digital experience feel like I was customizing my character and clothing at the beginning of a game.
